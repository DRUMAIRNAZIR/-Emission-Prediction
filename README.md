# -Emission-Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting carbon emissions based on various factors. The goal of this project is to provide insights and predictive models that can help in understanding and mitigating the environmental impacts of carbon emissions.
Project Overview
The project uses machine learning techniques to predict carbon emissions based on historical data. Various environmental and economic factors are taken into account to build a robust model. The steps involved include data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing data for model input.
Modeling: Multiple models are tested, including linear regression and decision trees.
Evaluation: The models are evaluated based on accuracy and performance metrics like RMSE.
